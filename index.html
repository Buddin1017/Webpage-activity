    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>As a team of computer science students, we hope to create a team that's built on the foundation of honesty, accountability, and fairness. We believe that mutual respect and strong communication is essential for success. By combining our technical skills, we hope to improve not only our abilities as developers but our character as well.</p>
    <h2>Our Team Rules</h2>
    <p>1. Team members can still get equal credit if they let us know in advance about their issues but complete ghosting is unacceptable.</p>
    <p>2. Team members must stick to their assigned roles and communicate before taking over someone elseâ€™s task.</p>
    <p>3. Tasks will be clearly assigned and agreed upon by everyone.</p>
    <p>4. Team members will communicate respectfully and try to solve disagreements together.</p>
    <p>5. Team members must make a genuine effort to contribute their best to group work, if their work is subpar, they may be held accountable. They may ask for help to prevent mediocre quality.</p>
    <p>6. Team members must communicate early if they are falling behind so that the group can adjust workloads if needed.</p>
